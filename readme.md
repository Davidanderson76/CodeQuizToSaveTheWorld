My goal was to create a quiz with 10 questions.
The questions are based on identifying Marvel Superheroes.
Each question then gives you 10 seconds to select answer.
I wanted to include a picture with each question, this will be an image of the superhero
to be identified.
I wanted to give the user 3 options to select from.
Only one answer is correct.
Once the user selects an answer, if it is correct then the question marker will light up green.
If the user guesses incorrectly the question marker will turn red.
Finally, once all 10 questions are answered, the user will recieve their score on screen.
The image behind the score is selected based on how well you do.
    If you score 90% or above you will recieve a "happy" Deadpool face.
    If you score under 90% and above 80% you will recieve an "OK" Deadpool face. 
    If you score under 80% and above 70% you will recieve a "MEH" Deadpool face. 
    If you score under 70% and above 60% you will recieve an "EHH" Deadpool face. 
    If you score any lower than 60% you will recieve a "BAD" Deadpool face.

The answers selected by the user are run through an answer checking function, that checks the users input with the correct answer within the object array.

To start the quiz simply click on the "Start Quiz" button.

Think fast because the timer starts as soon as the question pops up!
